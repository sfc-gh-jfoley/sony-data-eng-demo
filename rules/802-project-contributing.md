## Contract

### Inputs and Prerequisites
- Forked repository with feature branch
- Development environment set up (Python 3.11+, Task, uv, Ruff)
- Understanding of rule numbering scheme and governance standards
- Access to CONTRIBUTING.md and 002-rule-governance.md

### Mandatory
- Git (fork, clone, branch, commit, PR)
- Task runner (lint, format, validate, generate)
- Ruff (linting and formatting)
- uv (package management)
- Python validation scripts

### Forbidden
- Direct editing of deployed rule files outside rules/ directory
- Committing without validation (task rules:validate)
- Force push to main/master branches
- Amending commits authored by others

### Execution Steps
1. Fork repository and create feature branch following naming conventions
2. Edit rules/ directory files directly (production-ready rules)
3. Follow Conventional Commits format for all commit messages
4. Update CHANGELOG.md under ## [Unreleased] for user-facing changes
5. Validate with task rules:validate and task lint
6. Submit PR with descriptive title and complete description
7. Address all code review feedback before merge

### Output Format
Well-structured pull request with:
- Conventional Commit title
- Clear description of changes and motivation
- Links to related issues
- Validation checklist completed
- Before/after examples (if applicable)

### Validation
**Pre-Task-Completion Checks:**
- CONTRIBUTING.md read before making changes
- Rule numbering scheme verified
- Tool availability checked in Taskfile.yml
- Conventional Commits format understood

**Success Criteria:**
- task rules:validate passes without critical errors
- task lint passes cleanly
- task format passes without changes
- CHANGELOG.md updated (if user-facing change)
- All commits follow Conventional Commits format
- Generated files included in PR (task rule:all run)

### Design Principles
- **Investigation-First** - Read CONTRIBUTING.md before making changes
- **Conventional Commits** - Standardized commit message format
- **Changelog Discipline** - Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
- **Validation-First** - Run validation before committing
- **Code Review** - Address all feedback before merge

- [ ] All code review feedback addressed

## Anti-Patterns and Common Mistakes

### Anti-Pattern 1: Editing Deployed Rules Without Validation
```bash
# Bad: Direct edit without validation
vim /some/project/.cursor/rules/100-snowflake-core.md
git add /some/project/.cursor/rules/100-snowflake-core.md
```
**Problem:** Changes to deployed rules should be made in source rules/ directory, not in deployment locations.

**Correct Pattern:**
```bash
# Good: Edit source rules
vim rules/100-snowflake-core.md
task rules:validate  # Validate changes
git add rules/100-snowflake-core.md
```
**Benefits:** Changes in canonical source location, validated before deployment

### Anti-Pattern 2: Vague Commit Messages
```bash
# Bad: No context or type
git commit -m "updated stuff"
git commit -m "WIP"
git commit -m "fixed bug"
```
**Problem:** Unclear change type, no scope, breaks changelog automation, unhelpful for code review

**Correct Pattern:**
```bash
# Good: Conventional Commits with clear scope
git commit -m "feat(snowflake): add Snowpipe continuous ingestion patterns"
git commit -m "fix(python): correct FastAPI async route examples"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update Quick Start with dual-platform git clone"
```
**Benefits:** Clear change type, automated changelog generation, searchable commit history

### Anti-Pattern 3: Skipping Validation
```bash
# Bad: Commit without validation
git add rules/new-rule.md
git commit -m "feat(rule): add new rule"
git push
```
**Problem:** May contain structural errors, invalid metadata, broken references, fails CI checks

**Correct Pattern:**
```bash
# Good: Validate before commit
vim rules/new-rule.md
task rules:validate  # Ensure compliance
task lint           # Check code quality
git add rules/new-rule.md
git commit -m "feat(rule): add new rule"
```
**Benefits:** Catch errors early, ensure governance compliance, pass CI checks

### Anti-Pattern 4: Mixing User and Contributor Content in README
```markdown
# Bad: Detailed development commands in README
```
**Problem:** README should focus on users, not development setup
**Correct Pattern:** Move development setup, build instructions, and contributor guidelines to CONTRIBUTING.md

## Output Format Examples

```markdown
MODE: ACT

Investigation:
- Read CONTRIBUTING.md to understand workflow
- Checked rule numbering scheme in 002-rule-governance.md
- Verified 200-299 range is for Python rules
- Identified next available number: 215

Implementation:

Created new rule: rules/210-python-fastapi-core.md

File Structure:
- Metadata: Description, Type, AppliesTo, Keywords, TokenBudget (~2200)
- Quick Start TL;DR with 7 essential patterns
- 5 detailed sections covering Django best practices
- Anti-patterns section with 3 examples
- Investigation-First Protocol
- Response Template

Updated CHANGELOG.md:
```markdown

## Implementation Details

### Commit & Changelog Discipline
- **Requirement:** Follow Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>`.
- **Requirement:** Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `test`.
- **Requirement:** Use descriptive scopes aligned with rule categories:
  - Core: `core`, `governance`, `memory-bank`
  - Snowflake: `snowflake`, `sql`, `streamlit`, `spcs`
  - Python: `python`, `fastapi`, `lint`, `setup`
  - Shell: `bash`, `zsh`, `shell`
  - Project: `changelog`, `readme`, `contributing`, `taskfile`
  - Analytics: `data-science`, `governance`, `business`
- **Always:** After user-facing changes, update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`.
- **Requirement:** Each changelog entry is a single concise line; collapse micro-fixes.
- **Requirement:** Avoid anti-patterns: "WIP" subjects, unscoped types for multi-domain changes, mixing features and fixes.

### Rule Authoring Standards

#### Rule File Structure
- **Requirement:** Follow 3-digit numbering scheme with clear domain separation:
  - `000-099`: Core Foundation (global, memory-bank, governance)
  - `100-199`: Data Platform - Snowflake
  - `200-299`: Software Engineering - Python
  - `300-399`: Software Engineering - Shell Scripts
  - `500-599`: Data Science & Analytics
  - `600-699`: Data Governance
  - `700-799`: Business Intelligence
  - `800-899`: Project Management
  - `900-999`: Demo & Synthetic Data

#### Rule Content Guidelines
- **Requirement:** Keep rules 150-300 lines (max 500 lines).
- **Requirement:** Split large topics into multiple composable rules within the same range.
- **Requirement:** Use explicit directive language: `Requirement`, `Always`, `Avoid`, `Rule`, `Consider`.
- **Always:** Include metadata header with Description, AppliesTo, AutoAttach, Type, Version, LastUpdated.
- **Always:** Reference related rules using `@rule-name.md` syntax.

#### Subdomain Organization
- **Rule:** Use 10-number ranges for framework-specific rules:
  - Python FastAPI: `210-219`
  - Bash Scripting: `300-309`
  - Zsh Scripting: `310-319`
- **Rule:** Use 20-number jumps for major feature areas (e.g., `120` for Snowflake SPCS).

### General Code Standards
- **Requirement:** SQL must use uppercase keywords and explicit identifiers (avoid `SELECT *`).
- **Requirement:** Shell scripts must include proper shebang and error handling (`set -euo pipefail`).
- **Always:** New behavior should include at least one happy-path test and one negative/edge case test.
- **Requirement:** Test function names follow `test_<function>_when_<condition>_should_<result>`.
- **Always:** Reference specialized rules as needed (e.g., `200-python-core.md`, `300-bash-scripting-core.md`).

### Contributing Content Boundaries
```
[50 lines of detailed development workflow]
[Environment setup instructions]
[Rule generation commands]
[Validation procedures]
```
**Problem:** Overwhelms end users, violates progressive disclosure principle, creates maintenance burden

**Correct Pattern:**
````markdown
# Good: Minimal pointer in README

## README vs CONTRIBUTING.md Content Boundaries

**Principle:** Progressive disclosure - users first, contributors second

**README.md Should Contain:**
- Project overview and value proposition
- Quick Start for end users
- Installation and usage instructions
- Troubleshooting for users
- Minimal contributor pointer with quick reference commands
- License and acknowledgments

**CONTRIBUTING.md Should Contain:**
- Complete development workflow
- Environment setup details
- Code quality and linting procedures
- Rule authoring standards
- PR templates and review process
- Configuration safety guidelines
- Testing requirements
- Validation procedures

**Boundary Pattern:**
```markdown

## Dual-Platform Repository Support

**Requirement:** Projects hosted on multiple platforms must document both in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Quick Start Section Pattern:**
```markdown

### Pull Requests & Branching
- **Requirement:** PR titles must follow Conventional Commits.
- **Requirement:** PRs must contain delta-only edits; avoid unrelated formatting.
- **Always:** For multi-user projects, submit PRs to a protected `main` branch.
- **Rule:** When adding new rules, update README.md to reflect the new structure.
- **Rule:** When modifying rule numbering, ensure all cross-references are updated.

- **Rule:** For new frameworks, reserve 10-number subrange (e.g., 220-229 for Django)
- **Always:** Update README.md rule categories section
- **Always:** Validate rule follows governance standards in `002-rule-governance.md`

### Documentation References
